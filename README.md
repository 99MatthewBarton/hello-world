# hello-world
first GitHub repo

Hi GitHub!
I am currently a computer science student studying in Australia.
I'm hoping to expand my knowledge of programming but learning GitHub.
Eventually I would like to have a portfolio of projects built here.
Currently I mostly know Java, with a splash of Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
